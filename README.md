# AutomaticVusualisation
 
 This project involves developing R function for automac visualisation.
 The function draws graphics basing on explanatory variables types.
 
## How does it work: 
 The function takes as parameters the database, the response variable, 
 and explanatory variables. For each explanatory variable, one graphic is drawn based on the 
 type of the explanatory variable. The function has an optional logical parameter named all,
 which is TRUE, the graphics are plotted for all variables in the database, excluding the 
 response variable.
